  This is my first neuron-network project. The goal is to recognize digits from 0 to 9. I was largly inspired by a set of video created by 3 blue 1 brown. Youtube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk. 
  The dataset is mnist. Link: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
  And I used exactly same neuron network described in the very video. That's a fully connected neuron-network with an input layer(784), two hidden layer(16), an output(10ï¼‰layer.
